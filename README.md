# Data and Methods

Focusing n the pandemic of 1957 and not the pandemic of 1968, genomic information was fetched from IVR for influenza A isolates collected prior to 1966. Fetched sequences were pared down to strains with all 8 gene segments sequenced resulting in a final dataset of 148 strains for gene reassortment analysis.
